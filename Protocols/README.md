# Protocols

This directory contains our protocols, most are pretty specific so you will probably need to adapt them slightly for your own needs, final copies of each protocol will be moved into manuscript specific repositories as they are finalised for publishing so will appear in two places.

## Within this directory (use at own risk):
* [Protocols_under_development](https://github.com/NewcastleUni-NetworkEcologyGroup/Opentrons/tree/master/Protocols/Protocols_under_development) - a collection of partially finished protocols that we are testing and getting ready for deployment
	*[Labware_checking_protocols](https://github.com/NewcastleUni-NetworkEcologyGroup/Opentrons/tree/master/Protocols/Protocols_under_development/Labware_checking_protocols) - random fragments of script used for troubleshooting and refining labware and intruments
