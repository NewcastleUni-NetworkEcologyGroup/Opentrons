# Protocols

This directory contains our protocols, most are pretty specific so you will probably need to adapt them slightly for your own needs. Copies of each protocol will be moved into manuscript specific repositories as they are finalised for publishing so if you want a protocol that integrates into a specific manuscripts methods, fork the specific repo.

## Within this directory (use at own risk):
* [Protocols_under_development](https://github.com/NewcastleUni-NetworkEcologyGroup/Opentrons/tree/master/Protocols/Protocols_under_development) - a collection of partially finished protocols that we are testing and getting ready for deployment

	*[Labware_checking_protocols](https://github.com/NewcastleUni-NetworkEcologyGroup/Opentrons/tree/master/Protocols/Protocols_under_development/Labware_checking_protocols) - random fragments of script used for troubleshooting and refining labware and intruments
